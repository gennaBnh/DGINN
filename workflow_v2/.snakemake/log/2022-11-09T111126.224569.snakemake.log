MissingOutputException in rule init in line 8 of /Users/Genna/DGINN2/workflow_v2/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/config_update.json completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Shutting down, this might take some time.
